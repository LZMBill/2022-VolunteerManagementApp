<h2 id="1"> Overview</h2>

We're working on a website that can be used by different communities to help self organise, keep track of need and effectively deploy help. We focus on building an intuitive front-end design and a system which all users can interact with.

The application uses a Django project integrated with a vue application.

#### Install Docker: https://www.docker.com

To get running locally and quickly, download docker, clone this repository, then start the applications using this command in the api directory:

    docker-compose up --build

Then run the following command in the home directoryï¼š
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f development.yml up --build
```

This downloads all required node modules for the vue app.

Restart the tofro-django container and get running!!

To get the website running open the following url:

<h2 id="5"> 1.5 UX design </h2> 
To design an interactive user interface we employed general UX design methods, such as Journey Mapping, listing user personas and requirements. We aim to follow a UX design pattern.
