<h2 id="1">Overview</h2>

We're working on a website that can be used by different communities to help self organise, keep track of need and effectively deploy help. We focus on building an intuitive front-end design and a system which all users can interact with.

The application uses a Django project integrated with a vue application.

#### Install Docker: https://www.docker.com

To get running locally and quickly, download docker, clone this repository, then start the applications using this command in the api directory:

    docker-compose up --build

Then run the following command in the home directoryï¼š
```

<h2 id="7"> 1.5 UX design </h2> 
To design an interactive user interface we employed general UX design methods, such as Journey Mapping, listing user personas and requirements. We aim to follow a UX design pattern.

<h2 id="12">1.6 Ethics</h2> 
In our group, we are committed to upholding ethical standards in everything we do.  However, there are certain things that cannot be avoided.  For example, if coordinators use this application, we need to know their email addresses, addresses, phone numbers, and personal information.  To avoid concerns about privacy and security, obtaining ethical approval is crucial.

To provide a good user experience, we have established the following ethical principles:
- We will prioritize the safety of our users.
- We will respect the privacy of our users and will never use their data for any purpose other than the intended one.
- We will listen to feedback and criticism from our users and will use it to improve our products and services.

By adhering to these principles, we hope to create a culture of respect that benefits everyone in our group.
